            I am a math major at Princeton University taking a gap year to
            fulfill my social service duty in Korea. I have been excited about
            Artificial Intelligence ever since I developed a chess engine with
            C++ in middle school. Currently, I am studying Deep Learning and
            Reinforcement Learning with Python through online resources. I am
            also participating in several competitions to improve my developer
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not studying, I enjoy playing Table Tennis and Badminton.
