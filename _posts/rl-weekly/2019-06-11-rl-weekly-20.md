**What it is**

MineRL is a competition for the upcoming NeurIPS 2019 conference. The competition uses the Minecraft environment, and the goal of the participants is to train the agent to obtain diamonds. This is a very difficult task, so the organizers also provide the MineRL dataset, which is a large-scale dataset of human demonstrations.

The competition started a few days ago and will end on October 25th. According to the organizers, Preferred Networks will be releasing a set of baselines for the competition soon.

**Why it matters**

Reinforcement learning competitions are amazing opportunities for new RL researchers to gain first-hand experience. MineRL offers a unique opportunity by providing human demonstration data. It is difficult for individual researchers to collect large amount of demonstrations to test their ideas. The competition alleviates this problem and allows researchers to implement their own algorithms without worrying about collecting data.

**What it is & Why it matters**

Traditionally, a trained agent is evaluated by interacting with the target environment. Although this is feasible when the target environment is a simulated environment, it may be problematic in real-life applications like robotics. In these cases, off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods should be used. Different from existing OPE methods that require a good model of the environment or use importance sampling, this paper frames OPE as a "positive-unlabeled" classification problem. A state-action pair is labeled "effective" if an optimal policy can achieve success in that situation, and "catastrophic" otherwise. The intuition lies in that a well-learnt Q-function should return high value for effective state-action pair and low value for catastrophic state-action pair.

**What it is & Why it matters**

The authors propose a LSTM architecture with a soft, top-down, spatial attention mechanism. The paper is not the first to propose using attention in RL agents, but the numerous experiments show how attention can be used to qualitatively evaluate and interpret agents' abilities. The project website below shows how attention can be used to understand how the agent reacts to novel states, how the agent plans, and what the agent's strategy is.
