**What it says**

In one-player RL benchmarks Atari or MuJoCo, the environment does not actively try to make agents fail. In contrast, in zero-sum games such as Chess or Go, the opponent strives to crush the agent. Such a setting requires the agent to be robust against diverse opponent strategies, and many researchers have used self-play to ensure robustness. However, what happens if an adversarial opponent is directly trained against the agent?

The authors show that the adversarially trained opponents could reliably beat the "victims", not by becoming better at the task, but by creating adversarial observations. Four two-player robotics games shown above are used as environments, and the adversaries are trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a sparse reward for match results. The video above shows the  "You Shall Not Pass" environment, where the runner's goal is to reach the finish line, and the blocker's goal is to prevent that. In the video, the trained adversary (red humanoid) never stands up, yet the victim (blue humanoid) struggles to reach the finish line.

The authors offer further analysis of this phenomenon. Against humanoid with random actions and one with no actions, the victim consistently wins, showing that the victim policies are "robust to off-distribution observations that are not adversarially optimized." The authors also test "masked" victims that cannot observe the adversary's position and find that the masked victim can reliably win against the adversary, although it struggles against normally trained opponents. Finally, the authors show that victims that are fine-tuned against an adversary is robust against that particular adversary, but is still vulnerable to a different adversary trained with this same method against the fine-tuned victim.

## Image Augmentation Is All You Need: Regularizing Deep Reinforcement Learning from Pixels {#DrQ}

**What it says**

Data Augmentation is widely used in vision and speech domains, but it is not often used in RL, especially in non-robotics domains. (In robotics, OpenAI used extensive data augmentation for [dexterous in-hand manipulation](https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/), and Hindsight Experience Replay can also be seen as a type of data augmentation.) To justify the need for data augmentation, the authors train Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) on the DeepMind control suite using image encoder architectures of various sizes while keeping the policy network architecture the same. The performance decreases as the parameter count of the encoder network increases, indicating that there is an overfitting problem. The authors propose Data-regularized Q (DrQ), an algorithm that uses image augmentation in RL to perturb input observations and regularize the Q-function.

DrQ can be divided into three parts, denoted Orange, Green, and Blue in the pseudocode above. The first augmentation is performed on the observations sampled from the replay buffer by shifting the 84-by-84 image by 4 pixels. The second augmentation is done on target Q-function by estimating Q-values of augmented observations and taking the mean of those values to reduce the variance. Similarly, the third augmentation is done on the Q-function.

In DeepMind control suite, DrQ with SAC achieves equal or better performance compared to CURL, PlaNet, SAC-AE, and SLAC, with scores comparable to SAC trained with internal states.

**What it says**

Most RL agents are specialists: they excel at one pre-specified task but fail to generalize between tasks. To develop a task-agnostic agent, the authors propose training the agent in an environment without specifying a task. Since a task is defined by the reward function, the agent must learn without any rewards through self-guided exploration. The authors address this exploration problem by learning a world model to estimate "the expected novelty of future situations" without actual environment interactions.

The learning occurs in two phases: the model learning phase and the task adaptation phase. In the first phase, the agent gathers trajectories to train both the world model and the latent disagreement ensemble. The agent is then trained using the world model with latent disagreement rewards to encourage exploration. The trained agent is then deployed to the real environment again to gather more trajectories and the process is repeated. In the second phase, the policy is fine-tuned using the world model with a reward function distilled to the latent space. The trained agent collects task-specific trajectories that are added to the dataset, and the process is repeated.

The Plan2Explore algorithm is tested in the DeepMind control suite in two settings: zero-shot learning and few-shot learning. For zero-shot learning, the agent cannot collect task-specific trajectories in the adaptation phase and must be trained without reward supervision. Plan2Explore achieves better performance than other unsupervised RL agents such as Curiosity and  Model-based Active Exploration (MAX). For few-shot learning, Plan2Explore also achieves better performance than other unsupervised RL agents and is able to achieve scores competitive to RL agent with task supervision (Dreamer) after just a few episodes.
