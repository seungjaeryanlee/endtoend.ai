**What it says**

Observational overfitting is a phenomenon "where an agent overfits due to properties of the observation which are irrelevant to the latent dynamics of the MDP family." For example, in the saliency map above, the score and the background objects are highlighted red as they are deeply correlated with progress. This could hinder generalization: the authors report that simply covering the scoreboard with a black rectangle during training resulted in a 10% increased test performance. The authors use a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to validate the phenomenon, and find that overparametrizing potentially helps as a form of "implicit regularization." The authors also try ImageNet networks (AlexNet, Inception, ResNet, etc.) on CoinRun environments, and show that overparametrization improves generalization to the test set.

**What it says**

Estimating the value function is a critical part of RL, as it quantifies how choosing an action in a state affects future return. The reverse of this is the credit assignment question: "given an outcome, how relevant were past decisions?" The authors define the "hindsight distribution" of an action as the conditional probability of the first action of the trajectory being that action over trajectories given some outcome (either state-dconditional or return-conditional). This learned hindsight distribution can be used to better estimate value functions or policy gradients. The authors validate new algorithms that use Hindsight Credit Assignment in a few diagnostic tasks.

**What it says**

OpenAI (Cobbe et al.) released a set of 15 new environments similar to the CoinRun environment released last year, where the environments are "procedurally generated." Having content procedurally generated in many aspects (level layout, game assets, entity spawn location and timing, etc.) encourages the agent to learn a policy robust to such variations. Procedurally generated environments also allow for a natural division of training and test set by generating different environments.
