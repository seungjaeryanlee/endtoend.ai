Welcome to **Pommerman**! Pommerman is one of NIPS 2018 Competition tracks,
where the participants seek to build agents to compete against other agents in a
game of Bomberman.

In this post, we simply explain the basics of Pommerman, leaving reinforcement
learning to later posts.



## Game Description

Every game of Pommerman starts in a 11-by-11 grid. There are four agents, one
at each corner. Every agent starts with one bomb and a blast strength of 3. The
agent can increase these numbers and can kick the bomb by acquiring power-ups.

The game ends when only players from one team remains. It is possible that the
game does not end until max timestep, or both team's last agents are destroyed
in the same turn. Then, the game is rerun two more times. Upon three consecutive
ties, the game ends with a loss for both teams.

For the full description, check the [**Game Description**](https://www.pommerman.com/about). For the full rules, check the [**Game Rules**](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/tree/master/pommerman#game-rules) and [**Game Rules Doc**](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/blob/master/docs/game_rules.md).

### Variants

There are three variants of Pommerman:

 - **Free for All (FFA)**: One agent each from 4 participants compete against each other. The board is fully observable.
 - **Team**: Two agent each from 2 participants compete against each other. The board is partially observable for each agent. Each agent must be completely separate and cannot share any information.
 - **Team Radio**: Same as *Team*, but the agent is allowed to send short "words" to another agent to share information.

In the NIPS 2018 Competition, the **Team** version is used, where each
participant submits two agents and plays against two agents from another
participant. The agents can be different, employing different strategies.

For those who wonder why *Team Radio* was not chosen for NIPS 2018, it was
because the partial observability and multi-agent aspects added in *Team* made
the competition complex enough. (For example, AlphaGo Zero cannot be used with
POMDPs without modification) The communication is too difficult within a huge
environment.



## Board

### Board Types

Each square is either a passage, contains a wall, a bomb, a power-up, or an
agent, or is a fogged-out area.

Walls block the agent's movement. There are two types of walls: wood wall and
rigid wall. Wood walls are walls that can be broken by bombs that might have
power-up item hidden behind it. There are 48 randomly placed wood walls in each
map. Rigid walls cannot be broken.

Bombs are placed by agent and explodes after 10 timesteps. When the bomb
explodes, it destroys any wooden walls, agents, or power-ups and triggers other
bombs in the range. Bombs can be kicked by agents that has the Can Kick
power-up.

Power-ups are behind wooden walls and are revealed when the wooden wall is
destroyed. There are 20 power-ups hidden under 48 wood walls, so each wall has
approximately 40% chance of an item.

For more information, check [**Agent Observations**](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/tree/master/pommerman#agent-observations).

### Fog

The environment is partially observable, hence the name *Partially Observable
Mmerman*. The agent can look up to 4 units in each direction
([Source](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/blob/939921e7d7e70fe9715a9f1c5d3ed472a40d2758/pommerman/constants.py#L12)). Everywhere outside this range is observed as a fog by the agent.

To make sure that the agent isn't killed by a bomb that it does not see, the
bomb's max blast strength is restricted by the agent's view size ([Source](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/blob/0017eef3e0c137c329f50bf048be289ca691260d/pommerman/envs/v0.py#L187)).



## Installation

The `pommerman` package is not uploaded in a package index like PyPI or Anaconda
Cloud, so it must be installed by cloning the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground
cd playground
pip install -U .
```

The `playground` repository not only contains the `pommerman` package, but also
useful scripts and notebooks.

For the full installation guide, check [**Getting Started**](https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/tree/master/docs).
