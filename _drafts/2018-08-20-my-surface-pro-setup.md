    Due to portability, Surface Pro has become my primary machine. Here are several programs I installed to make working in Windows more convenient.

Ever since I started using Linux, my primary OS has been Linux. However, since I started reading papers every day, I found the need to buy a tablet. Instead of buying an iPad Pro and carrying it with my ThinkPad, I decided to buy a Surface Pro to lighten my load. My only concern was that my past experience with Windows was not ideal when it came to programming.

After a few weeks, I believe I made the right decision. Most of my computationally intensive jobs are done on the server now, so there were only a few programs to install.



## Programming

### Anaconda

[[Website]](https://anaconda.org/)

Anaconda is a package distribution system (like pip) with virtual environment capabilities. In my opinion, it has fewer packages than PyPI, but has a great virtual environment support compared to `virtualenv`. Thus, I use it mainly to create and manage virtual environments.



### Cygwin

**Cygwin** is collection of GNU and Open Source tools to make Windows feel like Linux. My primary reason for installing Cygwin was Bash, but there are many more interesting packages.



### Cmder

**Cmder** is a console emulator for Windows. This is a big improvement over the default Cygwin terminal, as it allows multiple tabs. I previously used ConEmu, but the $\lambda$ symbol won me over.



### VSCode

[[Website]](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Since my transition from Sublime Text, **VSCode** has been my go-to editor for projects that do not require a full-fledged IDE like PyCharm.



## General

### Drawboard PDF

**Drawboard PDF** is the PDF editor that I use to read and annotate academic papers.



### Mendeley

[[Website]](https://www.mendeley.com/)

**Mendeley** is a reference manager that I use primarily to organize academic papers that I have annotated. I am not using this program anywhere near its full capacity, but it has been a good paper management tool. The only caveat is that Mendeley does not seem to support 4K.



### Typora

[[Website]](https://typora.io)

**Typora** is an elegant Markdown editor that I always use to write my blog posts.



### WindowGrid

[[Website]](http://windowgrid.net/)

**WindowGrid** is a simple window management program that allows users to easily layout their windows on a grid. I found it immensely helpful in windows layout when I connect my Surface to a single big screen.

Overall, my experience with Surface Pro has been surprisingly positive.
