  title: "RL Weekly Week 24"
  supporting_text: "This week, we summarize two benchmark papers. The first paper benchmarks 11 model-based RL algorithms in 18 continuous control environments, and the second paper benchmarks 4 bonus-based exploration methods in 9 Atari environments. Both papers agree that a standardized benchmark is needed for an objective analysis of new algorithms."
